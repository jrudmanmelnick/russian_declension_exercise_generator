#By: Julie Rudman-Melnick
#Last Updated: 8/14/22

#Purpose: This code provides a simple way to practice the system of Russian declension by generating exercises 

#Instructions: 
#1. Save the CSV file in desired location. Update the location of the CSV file in the russ_dict_data line
#2. Run code in RStudio (ensure that the manipulate package is installed)
#3. Click on the gray item in the upper left hand corner of the plot
#4. Select from the drop down menu the which case to practice (accusative, genitive, dative, instrumental, or prepositional). 
#Click new Exercise
#5. Answer the question that appears in the plot
#6. Check answer by looking at the latest line in the R console

#Possible future updates: 
#-expand the dictionary, including a variety of nouns and adjectives (with handling for e.g. animate vs. inanimate and other nuances)
#-add a way for user to input an answer (e.g. on screen Russian keyboard) and for the code to check if the user's answer is correct
#-Replatform to Python or Java
#-provide a mini context for the case requested (e.g. for instrumental case, C + _____)
#-add the option to practice a random case
#-write the rules for declension into the code instead of relying on a dictionary
